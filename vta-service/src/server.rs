    // the ATM's secrets resolver and so needs no route. That reasoning is
    // wrong, and wrong in a way nothing here could show. Every TSP entry point
    // in the messaging SDK goes through `ATMProfile::dids()`, which *errors*
    // without a mediator: `unpack_bytes` calls it to check the envelope's
    // receiver, `pack` to name the sender, and `send_raw` also needs
    // `get_mediator_rest_endpoint()`. So that profile could neither send nor
    // unseal, and answered every attempt with `ConfigError("No Mediator is
    // configured for this Profile")` before touching the network — which reads
    // as an internal error rather than as missing wiring.
    //
    // The profile that works is the one `messaging::service::build_messaging`
    // registers against the mediator, and it is published on the bridge. Read
    // it via `AppState::tsp_transport`.
